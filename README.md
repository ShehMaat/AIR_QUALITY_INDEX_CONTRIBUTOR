🌫️ Air Quality Index Contributor
A Streamlit-based web application to estimate AQI contribution from construction sites based on raw materials used.

📌 Project Description
The Air Quality Index Contributor project aims to assess and quantify the impact of construction activities on air pollution. By calculating the emissions of seven major pollutants from the raw materials used at a construction site, this app provides an estimated AQI (Air Quality Index) contribution.
The project uses real-world data from Delhi, integrating machine learning to analyze pollutant concentrations and predict AQI values with a trained linear regression model.

🔍 Key Features
📦 Input Raw Materials used in a construction site.

🌫️ Estimate Emissions for 7 major air pollutants:
PM2.5
PM10
NO₂
SO₂
CO
O₃
NH₃
📊 Trained ML Model using Delhi AQI data (1 month) to predict AQI from pollutant concentrations.
🖥️ Streamlit Integration for a user-friendly interactive web interface.
🧾 Result Output: Final AQI score and its category (e.g., Moderate, Poor, Severe).
